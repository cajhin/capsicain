Ongoing stream of what I want to remember...

TODO
- tap+hold Alt
- clean up the ugly previousKeyEventInStore
- refactor the CAPS_ESC sequences; those should be easier now
- record macros on key in (today) or on key out?
- nicer macro 'language'
- enable/disable (layer0) toggle switch/vkey
- numbered trayicons
- test if SC_0Xnn still works in ini
- צה should not ignore CapsLock ON

New ini GLOBALs
- delayOnStartupMS {number} (default 0. Useful if you need time to release keys when starting capsicain with a shortcut)
- startMinimized (default false. Capsicain starts minimized in the taskbar)
- startInTraybar (overrides startMinimized. Capsicain starts with a traybar icon instead of toolbar icon)

ESC key
Always lazy key with Capsicain (fires on release)
ESC + mod makes sticky mods
REWIRE ESC X   The key will not autorepeat

Modified handling for showing hiding window / taskbar / traybar
- any command with "info output" pops up the window
- can't move to tray on minimize (console is out of the Win event loop, it only sees incoming keys)

v63
git branch vk
massive changes following the switch from 8bit scancode to int vcode...
scancode is original
vcode is copy of original; possibly changed later
now free to define many virtual codes for specific functions like "turn LED on"
rewireIfTapped: Tab is first mapped to mod10, then 'iftapped' to Tab later
now assume that keysDownSent[] really knows the state of what Windows knows

v65beta
rework the tapping stuff
double tap no longer breaks tap //TODO rework
removed OPTION ShiftShiftToCapsLock (obsolete)
COMBO can deal with modifiers like COMBO LSHF [&.] > key (CAPSON)
new VKeys CAPSON, CAPSOFF
warn about unknown OPTIONs
add GLOBAL startAHK

v66beta
check for unknown GLOBALs
move constants to constants.h
move rewire conf to array

v67beta
- rewire // stands for "don't process this". NOP results in action.
- add 'time since last key' to debug output
- detect slow taps (those clear any tapped state)

v68beta
Configurable TapHold. Phew. Tapdance is complicated.

v69beta VS2019
- upgrade from VS2017 to VS2019
- retarget to latest vcruntime, msvcp (not sure if this still works on Win7)
-> may need to distribute new DLLs //TODO
- c++ 14 > c++ 17
- linter complains about bit operations on unsigned char (suck)
- cleaned up three new warnings about conversion types
- app icon is broken for debug (suck)
- breaking change: PAUSE:10 is now SLEEP 1000.  Now sleeps n milliseconds (was 1/10s before)
- take care of moddedKeys / when and when not to release physical modifiers //TODO
- now moddedKey() releases ALL physical modifiers
