Ongoing stream of what I want to remember...

TODO
- finish v94, what about shiftconfig and fluid key repeat for gaming?
- timeout for tappings, deadkeys?
- nicer macro 'language'
- accented altChars should not ignore CapsLock ON
- rethink double tap breaking tapped state
- nicer syntax for input sequences (COMPOSE f y i [.T] > print("For your information")
- directly send UTF chars to the upper echelons
- license yaawn

CLEANUP
- precise timers, profiling
- move prints to separate file
- move ini loads
- console to win form with worker thread
- separate all windows stuff (prepare linux version)
- rework scancodes, E0 &0x80, iks state

v62 and older
New ini GLOBALs
- delayOnStartupMS {number} (default 0. Useful if you need time to release keys when starting capsicain with a shortcut)
- startMinimized (default false. Capsicain starts minimized in the taskbar)
- startInTraybar (overrides startMinimized. Capsicain starts with a traybar icon instead of toolbar icon)

ESC key
Always lazy key with Capsicain (fires on release)
ESC + mod makes sticky mods
REWIRE ESC X   The key will not autorepeat

Modified handling for showing hiding window / taskbar / traybar
- any command with "info output" pops up the window
- can't move to tray on minimize (console is out of the Win event loop, it only sees incoming keys)

v63beta
git branch dev
massive changes following the switch from 8bit scancode to int vcode...
scancode is original
vcode is copy of original; possibly changed later
now free to define many virtual codes for specific functions like "turn LED on"
rewireIfTapped: Tab is first mapped to mod10, then 'iftapped' to Tab later
now assume that keysDownSent[] really knows the state of what Windows knows

v65beta
rework the tapping stuff
double tap no longer breaks tap
removed OPTION ShiftShiftToCapsLock (obsolete)
COMBO can deal with modifiers like COMBO LSHF [&.] > key (CAPSON)
new VKeys CAPSON, CAPSOFF
warn about unknown OPTIONs
add GLOBAL startAHK

v66beta
check for unknown GLOBALs
move constants to constants.h
move rewire conf to array

v67beta
- rewire // stands for "don't process this". NOP results in action.
- add 'time since last key' to debug output
- detect slow taps (those clear any tapped state)

v68beta
Configurable TapHold. Phew. Tapdance is complicated.

v69beta VS2019
- upgrade from VS2017 to VS2019
- retarget to latest vcruntime, msvcp (not sure if this still works on Win7)
-> may need to distribute new DLLs
- c++ 14 > c++ 17
- linter complains about bit operations on unsigned char (suck)
- cleaned up three new warnings about conversion types
- app icon is broken for debug (suck)
- breaking change: PAUSE:10 is now SLEEP 1000.  Now sleeps n milliseconds (was 1/10s before)
- take care of moddedKeys / when and when not to release physical modifiers
- now moddedKey() releases ALL physical modifiers

v70beta: fix flipAppleKeys
- some doc cleanup
note: flipYZ does not clash with the new rewire style since it's soft and late anyway

v71beta: dead keys
- startup console size 800x600
- create diacritics with 
  COMBO U [..T.] > deadkey(U)  //tapped-RCtrl, U activates deadkey SC_U
  COMBO DEADKEY-U  A [& ....] > altChar(0196)  //RSHF+A with dk-U active = 'Ä'

v72beta: OR
- [...| ...|] matches, if LShift OR RShift is down
- deadkey fixes
- added a ton of accented characters to the ini

v73beta: no more VS DLLs, fix
- static linking, ms* DLLs no longer required (Properties > codegen > RTlib=MT)
- fix: works now: empty mod string like COMBO A [] > key(B)
- some .ini and .ahk cleanup

v74beta
- ESC will stop macro and user/password recording
- fix REWIRE A NOP something
- debug off by default
- only start one instance (release and debug can run in parallel)
- remove GLOBAL delayOnStartup. Not needed, keys are auto released
- layer change resets all states
- fix: reset all options to default on layer change
- clean up: debug string
- unfinished: icon for disabled
- Reset with ESC-BSP
- clean up: reload, layer change, all ESC commands work everywhere
- remove sticky mods feature. Too hacky to get it right

v75beta: tray icon indicates active layer

v76beta: GLOBAL capsicainEnableDisableKey
If defined, this toggles the disabled state.
The key will also be forwarded to Windows.
Nice: ScrLock indicates state with LED and is otherwise a useless key.

v77beta: change name to capsicainOnOffKey

v78beta: configurable layer change
- new functions > layerSwitch(0..9), > layerPrevious()
- disable Ctrl-C
- (new internal vkeys LAYERSWITCH, LAYERPREVIOUS)

v79: fix reload, final non-beta

v80: change ALL "Layer" to "Config"
- the word "Layer" was for historical reasons, it made no sense with how it works now.
- old .ini keywords with "layer" are still supported, but throw an 'INFO deprecated'
- set platform toolset to v141 so that VS2017 works out of the box

v81: rewire: undo preceding tapped state on tap&hold
- tap&hold always results in tap first. The 'mod tapped' state needs to be cleared
- cleanup modifier bitmask functions (take vcode instead of scancode)

v82beta: record/play simple macros (usr/pw, others)
- removed dedicated ESC+U ESC+P macros
- 10 configurable macros (+ the existing 'hard macro 0' with ESC JKL;)
- new .ini Combo functions
  o recordMacro(1..10)
  o recordSecretMacro(1..10) (never shown on the console, obfuscated in RAM)
  o playMacro(1..10)
- new internal VKeys 
  VK_CPS_RECORDMACRO, VK_CPS_RECORDSECRETMACRO, VK_CPS_PLAYMACRO, VK_CPS_OBFUSCATED_SEQUENCE_START
- tray icon to indicate recording is ongoing
- fix 'deadkey-x ] []' // 'combo(np++x)' // 'comboNtimes(x+,,3)'

v83beta: 
- fix logging of escape scancode E1
- ignore other arcane escape codes gracefully
- translate Ctrl-NumLock and Pause key (E1-Ctrl-NumLock) to new VK_CPS_PAUSE ("PAUSE")
- discard VK Pause if Capsicain is the foreground window, so Windows does not freeze it.
  This is not bullet proof. In disabled state / layer 0, capsicain does not check any keys.
  Still possible to menu > Edit > Mark > select text, which also pauses the console process.
- Windows formalities that show up in Properties (version, file description, ...)

v84beta: Performance timers, fix modstring []
- removed performance optimization that broke 'no-modifier' rules like 'combo x []'
- nicer debug output formatting
- compile time switch IFTRACE for low level details
- compile time switch IFPROF for time measurements while debug is off
- new performance profiling timers
  Result: the cost of debugging output is not maybe 50%, but 99%
  Average key processing time is 2ms with debugging on, and 0.02ms when off
  -> don't do minor performance optimizations, it's not worth it

v85beta: Enable hex input for altChar, like > altChar(+11D)
  requires 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Input Method\EnableHexNumpad 1'
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_input#Hexadecimal_input

v85beta2: max macros = 20+1

v86: handle the messy keys PRINT,SCRLOCK,PAUSE,NUMLOCK
- breaking change: key label SYSRQ is now PRINT
- esc to stop macro drops the esc event
- deal with physical mods that start macro record/play
- clean up Pause key
- crude bug in isModifierDown(), wasn't used. Removed.
  Faster check: macro IS_LCTRL_DOWN
- new vkeys BREAK, ALTPRINT
- new GLOBALs DontTranslateMessyKeys, DontProtectConsole
- by default drops BREAK and PAUSE signals when capsicain is foreground
- by default maps BREAK and pause-sequence to PAUSE, ALTPRINT to PRINT
- can use PAUSE as ON/OFF toggle (what a mess)

v87beta: capsicainOnOffKey can control the LEDs. Clean up On/Off with Pause
- if Global capsicainOnOffKey is one of the three keys with LEDs,
  the state of the LED is exclusively controlled by capsicain OnOff state,
  even when the actual function (like CapsLock) is changed via Combo.
- clean up onOff key. The key is never forwarded.
- fixed 'Autorepeating Pause as ON/OFF toggle sends Pause to foreground console'
- clean up 'previous key history'

v88: fix BOM handling

v89: new release

v90: merged bitoj's pull request #33 : LED reset on exit

v91: fix issue #35 (alpha_from, alpha_to)

v92: fix issue #32 (no 'locking key' state reset; fix LED handling)
- only reset the state of (Caps|Scr|Num)Lock on ESC+Backspace; not on startup, shutdown, KB change
- ESC does *not* reset ScrLock on Cherry, don't set LEDs on Esc (might have been confusion from the LED code)
- (send NumLock), then (get Windows NumLock state) was too fast for Win to register the change.

v93: merge bitoj's fixes

lic:
- any problem is your problem
- open ticket on redistribution, commercial rollout
- rename on modification; "based on capsicain""
- improve one detail in this world
