#REWIRE is useful to redefine modifier keys, or define new modifier keys.
#Regular modifier keys are [ MOD12 MOD11 MOD10 MOD9    RALT RWIN RCTRL RSHF    LALT LWIN LCTRL LSHF ]

# Make Tab into a second Left Control key. If you tap (press+release) Tab, the [TAB] key is sent
REWIRE    TAB    LCTRL   TAB

# Make CapsLock key the virtual modifier MOD9 key. If you tap (press+release) CapsLock, nothing happens (No OPeration).

#COMBO defines combinations of a basic key together with one or more modifiers.
#You always write it like  
#COMBO  someKeyThatWasPressed  [current state of the modifiers] > someFunction ( parameters )

#Modifiers can be down (&), up (^), tapped (T) or ignored (.)

    # When 'J' is pressed while virtual key MOD9 is down, send key('CursorLeft').
	# Remember, we rewired the Capslock key to MOD9, and the symbol for "and MOD9 down" is [....& .... ....]
COMBO    J		[...& .... ....] > key (LEFT)  
    # Note that Shift + Caps + J  results in  Shift + LEFT. The Shift key is not touched by this mapping, so Windows knows it is down.

#Hint: to look up the correct labels for keys, enable debug mode in capsicain with [ESC]+[D]
#      The capsicain window shows the label for the keys you press.

    # Map Caps + L I K to Cursor Right Up Down, because, HAVING THE CURSOR KEYS ON JKLI IS AWESOME!!! I don't know how people live without it.
COMBO    L		[...& .... ....] > key (RIGHT)

    # Do nothing when LCtrl + V is pressed
COMBO    V       [.... ..&.] > key (NOP)  #NOP is 'No OPeration', 'no key'


    # Bad config: Map LCtrl + N to CursorLeft
COMBO    N       [.... ..&.] > key (LEFT)
    # This does not work right. Windows knows Ctrl is down, so this results in Control + Left.
    # Here, it would be better to use a 'virtual' MOD9..MOD15 modifier instead of a 'real' modifier, because Windows does not see them.

    # Fix the last one: Map LCtrl + J to CursorLeft, but release the Control key before sending the combo.
	# Function 'moddedKey' is useful for sending combos that involve more than one modifier.
	# It always temporarily releases all pressed keys before it sends out a combo, and presses them again afterwards.
COMBO    J       [.... ..&.] > moddedKey ( LEFT + ....)  #LEFT without any modifiers

    # Map LCtrl + L to Ctrl-Alt-Delete

COMBO    A		[.... .... ...T] > altChar (132)  # ä
    # note that this rule also matches Tap-Lshift + Tap-RShift + A.  The extra tap is ignored. So, this must come *after* the more specific rule for Ä

    # Map Tapped-LShift + Tapped-RShift + Tapped-LControl + MOD9 + MOD10 + S   to   RAlt + RShift + LAlt + LWin + LCtrl + LShift  + U - and first release all keys that are down
